# Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
One of the central ML applications in human services is the distinguishing proof and determination of illnesses and diseases which are in any case considered hard-to-analyze.
This can incorporate anything from tumors which are hard to discover during the underlying stages, to other hereditary maladies. IBM Watson Genomics is a prime case
of how incorporating subjective registering with genome-based tumor sequencing can
help in making a quick finding. Berg, the biopharma goliath is utilizing AI to create
restorative medicines in zones, for example, oncology. P1vital’s PReDicT (Predicting
Response to Depression Treatment) means to build up a financially attainable approach
to analyze and give treatment in routine clinical conditions.

To overcome the difficulty of incomplete data, we use a latent factor model to reconstruct the missing data. 
We experiment on a regional chronic disease of cerebral infarction.We propose a new  decision tree ,Naive Bayes, Random forest algorithms using structured and unstructured data from hospital. 
To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing work focused on both data types in the area of medical big data analytics. Compared with several typical prediction algorithms, the prediction accuracy of our proposed algorithm reaches 94.8% with a convergence speed, which is faster than that of the Other algorithms.

Most of the disease become deadly because They can't be detected at an early stage.
If we can detect the disease as early as possible it is very easy to diagnosis.
Lives can be saved by this method.
With The advancement of Latest technologies and data collected, it has become so easy to detect disease at the earliest at very accurate way

We Used Three of the famous classification algorithms:
  Decision Tree
  Random Forest
  Naive Bayer’s
